# Instructions:
Using the Unity Editor to test your build
Use a connection cable to connect the headset to your PC (a charging cord should also work).
Connect the headset and launch the Meta Developer Hub application.
To open the Oculus PC App, use the toggle via the Meta Developer Hub.
When the Oculus Link App launches in the headset, you might need to provide permissions.
It should now play in the headset when you press the Play button in the Unity Editor.
Putting the headset's build into practice
With the headset connected, using the Meta Developer Hub app
Drag and drop the build's.apk file inside the application.
Select the option to put it straight onto the headset. 
The app should start playing immediately when it loads; if not, you can locate it installed on the headset or, if the headset is attached, you can play it via the Meta Developer App.
